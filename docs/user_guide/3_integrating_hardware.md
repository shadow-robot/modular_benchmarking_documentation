# Integrating hardware to the framework
As stated in the [previous section](./2_configuring_the_framework.md), the framework natively supports Universal Robots arms and is provided with all the packages required to operate (both in simulation and on physical setup) an EZgripper attached to an UR5 arm.
<!--Image ???-->
It is nevertheless likely that you are working with a different hardware. We are hence going to detail how to integrate a new arm, using as example the franka panda arm.
<!-- Do it with another gripper?-->
